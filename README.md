This is a simple, no bells and whistle todo list app. It's entirely offline and has a media player feature. I made and used it for several years, it still works fine. I am publishing it so others can use it as well

Download the exe file from the [release page, click here](https://github.com/vajradog/YakToDo/releases/tag/YakToDo) , or download the .py file and edit it to your hearts content.

Type your task in the task box and press enter to send it to the todo list, use the arrows to send each item/task to either doing or done columns. Select and delete (using keyboard) to delete an item. Browse background audio from your computer and let it play in loop while you focus on your task in hand. Good Luck!
